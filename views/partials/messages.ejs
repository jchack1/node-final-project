<!-- In this partial we are getting our errors array to render on on the page, if there is an error. We are looping through the errors array -->

<!-- When I have time I would like to fix the css for the error messages, because they currently show up on one line, right after each other. I don't like this but it is low priority, and I am not using bootstrap like Brad Traversy is so this will take me some time to figure out. -->

<!-- here we are saying that if we have a success message that is not an empty string, to display our success message

these messages are assigned in app.js

do the same for error message below this, and then again for just showing an error-->
